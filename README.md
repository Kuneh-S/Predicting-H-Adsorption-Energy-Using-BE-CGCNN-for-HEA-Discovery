# Predicting-H-Adsorption-Energy-Using-BE-CGCNN-for-HEA-Discovery
A novel bond-embedded crystal graph neural network model was employed to predict interatomic potentials in catalyst nanoclusters which would be used to predict their hydrogen adsorption energy. These predictions are much faster than traditional quantum simulations like density functional theory resulting in analysis of a vast compositional space as well as that of larger clusters. High entropy alloys were investigated as catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction using this model.
